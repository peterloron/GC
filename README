This is a simple python script that reads serial data, does a little parsing to pick out values and then pushes that data periodically to Pachube.

You will need to create a (currently) free Pachube account to receive and display the data. Once you have the account, proceed to get your API key.

You will need to edit the config.txt file to set the Pachube feed id and api key. Also tweak the serial port string to match whatever device you are using.
